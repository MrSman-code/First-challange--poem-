  <h1>Mr Romantic</h1>
  <p>
    In sickness, appetite fades from her sight, <br />
    Craving peppery fish through the darkest night. <br />
    Clouds gather, ominous and vast, <br />
    I journey West, the die is cast. <br />
    Long waits and travels, to the farthest shore, <br />
    To purchase that dish, she longs for even more. <br />
    Then, in the East, she must make her retreat, <br />
    Deliver that fish, with romantic sight, <br />
    As rain falls fast, and the cold winds greet. <br />
    Homeward-bound, wet, and shivering cold, <br />
    In the downpour's embrace, her story unfolds.
